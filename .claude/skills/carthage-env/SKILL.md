description: Describes the Carthage sandbox environment this project runs inside. Trigger this skill at the start of any session where the `$CARTHAGE` environment variable is set, or when the user asks "am I in a sandbox", "what can I do here", "is there sudo", "what's the network setup", "can I push from here", or any orientation question about this environment.

# Carthage sandbox orientation

If the `$CARTHAGE` environment variable is set, you are running inside a
Carthage sandbox container. Read `/etc/carthage/SANDBOX.md` for the rules
that apply to this environment — scoped mounts, no sudo, commit workflow,
`--dangerously-skip-permissions` guidance, and how to request additional
services or system packages. Note in particular that the host LAN is *not*
firewalled off; the container can reach anything the host user can reach.

If `$CARTHAGE` is unset, this skill is a no-op. You are on the host, and
the sandbox rules don't apply.
